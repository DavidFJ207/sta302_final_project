# STA302 Fall 2024 Final Project Part 1

## Research Proposal and Data Introduction

**Due Date:** October 4, 2024 by 8:00PM ET  

### Project Overview

The goal of this assignment is to propose a research question and introduce a dataset suitable for multiple linear regression. The proposal involves conducting a small literature review, defining predictors and a response variable, fitting a preliminary model, and conducting residual analysis. The final report will demonstrate whether the data meets the assumptions of linear regression and how well the model performs in answering the research question.

### Key Deliverables

- **Research Question:** Define and justify a linear regression model for your dataset.
- **Literature Review:** Summarize three peer-reviewed articles related to your research.
- **Data Description:** Analyze at least five predictor variables, including one categorical.
- **Model and Residual Analysis:** Fit a preliminary model and evaluate assumptions through residual plots.
