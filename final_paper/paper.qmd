# Potential Research Questions
## Business: How do price, customer reviews, and service features influence customer satisfaction and repeat business in the online retail industry?
## Studying: How do different study techniques and time management practices affect academic performance among university students?
## Electric Cars: Are electric vehicles more environmentally sustainable than gasoline-powered cars when accounting for the energy sources used for electricity generation?

# Work Division

## Group Member 1:
**Main Focus: Research and Data Analysis**

- **Contributions**: 
  - Locate and clean the dataset.
  - Write the **Data Description** section (300 words).
  - Fit the **Multiple Linear Regression Model** and write the **Preliminary Results** section (300 words).
  - Conduct **Residual Analysis** and create the required residual plots.

### Specific Tasks:
1. **Locate the dataset** that fits the project requirements (open-source, contains a response variable and at least 9 predictors).
2. **Clean the data**: Handle missing values, prepare numerical and categorical variables, and ensure it’s ready for regression.
3. **Write the Data Description**:
   - State where the data was found.
   - Describe how the data was originally collected by the curator.
   - Summarize the response variable and justify why it's suitable for linear regression.
   - Summarize the predictor variables, provide numerical/graphical summaries, and interpret the descriptive statistics.
4. **Fit the multiple linear regression model** using R, incorporating at least 5 predictors, including one categorical predictor.
5. **Conduct residual analysis**:
   - Check for violations of linear regression assumptions.
   - Create residual plots and interpret their results.
6. **Write the Preliminary Results**:
   - Report on the fitted model.
   - Discuss model assumptions (whether violated or not).
   - Compare the preliminary model results to findings from the literature (summarized by Group Member 2).

## Group Member 2:
**Main Focus: Research Question, Literature Review, and Report Writing**

- **Contributions**:
  - Write the **Introduction** section (350 words).
  - Conduct the **Literature Review**: Summarize three peer-reviewed academic papers related to the research question.
  - Write the **Ethics Discussion** section (100-200 words).
  - Compile the **Bibliography** and format citations.
  - Final editing and formatting of the proposal.

### Specific Tasks:
1. **Formulate the research question**: Define a clear, focused research question based on the chosen dataset and explain why it’s suitable for linear regression.
2. **Conduct the literature review**:
   - Find and summarize three peer-reviewed academic papers related to the topic.
   - Describe how each paper relates to the proposed research question and supports the use of linear regression.
3. **Write the Introduction**:
   - Introduce the relevance/importance of the research topic.
   - Clearly state the research question.
   - Summarize the results of the three academic papers and explain how they connect to your research.
   - Justify why linear regression is an appropriate tool for this analysis.
4. **Write the Ethics Discussion**: 
   - Assess whether the dataset is trustworthy and ethically collected
5. **Compile the bibliography**:
   - Ensure proper formatting and inclusion of references in the proposal using APA format.
6. **Final editing and formatting**:
   - Review the entire document
